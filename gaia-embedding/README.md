## GaiaNet's ERC20 Vulnerability AI

## Overview

GaiaNet has fine-tuned the LLAMA 3.1 model using our web embeddings generator tool, leveraging recent smart contract vulnerabilities data. Our ERC20 vulnerability smart contract reviewer runs efficiently on a 16GB MacBook Pro.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance:** Tailored to operate on standard hardware without compromising analysis depth.
- **Chrome Extension Integration:** Designed specifically for Blockchain Researchers to conduct in-depth vulnerability assessments directly from the browser.
- **Seamless Setup:** Follow our [tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/34f03b0e2dd848ef9e44043aea62dd96?sid=a9f8c145-1454-46f7-9c46-e1b39544c3ac) for a quick and hassle-free installation without the need to manage your own Qdrant instance.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Chrome Extension:** Add the GaiaNet extension to your Chrome browser.
2. **Configure the Reviewer:** Use the provided tutorial to set up the ERC20 vulnerability reviewer on your MacBook Pro.
3. **Start Analyzing:** Upload your smart contract code and let the AI provide an in-depth vulnerability analysis.
